## **Sarcasm Target Detection**

## **Steps to run implementation of base paper**

## 1 - Prepare the dataset
a. Use "snippets.xlsx" from Dataset folder and upload it to colab notebook.<br/>
b. Use this shareable google drive link 'https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17bSbi_sxoyWN1mGmwzwV4lje9Q3uBmbs?usp=sharing' and choose 'Add shortcut to drive'.<br/>
c. Use this shareable google drive link 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SO4Y13N9ges5A4UM4gezgJtQMy5IjPZe/view' and choose 'Make a copy', to include 'crawl-300d-2M.vec'.<br/>

## 2 - Run the code
a. Open google colab and upload the 'SMDM_CodeBase.ipynb' from the code folder.<br/>
b. Go to runtime and click 'Run all', which will run all cells in sequential order.<br/>
c. The first cell will ask for the dataset, Upload the 'snippets.xlsx' file.<br/>
d. Mount your google drive.<br/>

## The code appproximately takes 40 minutes to run, once the code execution is finished, iterate to the last cell, to view the prediction accuracy over the training.
